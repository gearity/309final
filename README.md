# 309final
This repository contains my work for the STA309 final exam. There is the RMD/HTML file that contains the code itself, and a PNG of the dashboard I created within that code. The goal of this project was to determine which kind of model could best predict NBA playoff success, using Playoff Wins as the dependent variable, and a variety of team statistics as the predictors.
